I am an assistant professor at [Institute for Network Sciences and Cyberspace](http://www.insc.tsinghua.edu.cn/) 
,[Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/) in Beijing, China. 

**I'm always looking for highly motivated Ph.D., master, and undergraduate students interested in AI security, AI on Networking, Big Data Security, and Communication Security. Please send me an email with your CV if you are interested.**

Bio
------
Before joining Tsinghua University, I worked as a research engineer of the Laboratory of Information, Networking and Communication Sciences ([LINCS Lab](https://www.lincs.fr/)),  and co-affiliated with [Telecom Paris](https://www.telecom-paris.fr/en/home) in Paris, France from 2020.1 to 2021.2. I used to work as a PostDoc researcher at the Department of Network and Computer Science Department (INFRES), [Telecom Paris](https://www.telecom-paris.fr/en/home) in Paris, France from 2017.11 to 2019.12. Prior to that, I received my Ph.D. in [Telecom Paris](https://www.telecom-paris.fr/en/home) (previously known as "Telecom-ParisTech" before 2019) in France at 2017. I obtained my M.Eng degree from [Insitute Eurecom](https://www.eurecom.fr/en) in France, and a Bachelor's degree in Communication Engineering at [Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT)](https://english.bupt.edu.cn/) in China.

Research Interests
------
My research interests mainly focus on solving the security and privacy issues in computing systems, e.g. edge/cloud computing, image processing systems, big data, vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication systems, and deep learning-based intelligence systems. Currently, I am mainly working on AI security including Adversarial Examples (AE), Backdoor Learning, Privacy-preserving Machine Learning, Secure AI on Networking, etc.
